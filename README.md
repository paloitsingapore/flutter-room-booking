# room_booking

A new Flutter project.

## Localization

Localization in Flutter is... tricky!!

1 - Add messages in the file `lib/i18n/app_localization.dart`
2 - Run `yarn to-arb`
3 - Copy new messages from `lib/i18n/locale/intl_messages.arb` to locale specific `arb` files (e.g. `lib/i18n/locale/intl_en.arb`)
4 - Run `yarn from-arb`
